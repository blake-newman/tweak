###
  A Controller defines the business logic between other modules. It can be used to control data flow, logic and more. It
  should process the data from the Model, interactions and responses from the View, and control the logic between other
  modules.

  The Controller is the 'Middle man'; eliminating logic from the views. This prevents complexity and further organizes
  your code. It is not a required module to use, however every component has one for you to use. The benefits of the
  controller can include preprocessing of information and set-up of Components with its modules prior and after
  rendering a View. A Component upon its initialization will call the init method of its Controller module.

class Tweak.Controller extends Tweak.Events

    By default, this does nothing during initialization unless it is overridden.

    Note: You can apply logic to the constructor of the Controller, but you will not have any access to the other
    modules of the Component until the Component has been initialized.

    @example Providing set-up to a Component through the Controller.

      // Register the Controller to the Component's path name with a Module loader, this will allow the Component to
      // find its relating modules.
      // Using a CommonJS set-up

      require.register('dummy/controller', function(exports, require, module) {
        var DummyComponentController;
        return module.exports = exports = DummyComponentController = (function() {
          function DummyComponentController() {}

          Tweak.extends(DummyComponentController, Tweak.Controller);

          DummyComponentController.prototype.init = function() {
            // By passing true to to @model.set the model quietly updates
            return this.model.set('topping', this.component.config.topping, true);
          };

          return DummyComponentController;

        })();
      });
